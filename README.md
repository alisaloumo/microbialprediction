# Near Real-time and Next-Day Prediction for Escherichia coli (E. coli) in Highly Urbanized Watersheds
Microbial contamination of heavily urbanized watersheds is of significant public health concern. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is frequently traced as a fecal indicator bacterium (FIB) for microbial contamination, thereby highlighting the need for real-time predictive methods to support water quality management. Current predictive frameworks often lack inputs that simultaneously leverage a broad spectrum of environmental predictors (hydrometeorological, landscape, physicochemical, etc.), particularly antecedent rainfall characteristics that account for time-lagged microbial responses and capture spatial heterogeneity in contamination patterns. 
Our research proposes an effective, interpretable AI (XAI) model for E. coli concentration prediction in four scenarios: near real-time, same-day (no previous dayâ€™s data), same-day with lags (lagged predictors from previous days), and next-day prediction.
